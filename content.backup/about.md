# About this site

---

jQuery issues have moved to [GitHub](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues).

This site is now a static version of the old Trac bugs site.

> Trac is a web-based software project management and bug/issue tracking system emphasizing ease of use and low ceremony. It provides an integrated Wiki, an interface to version control systems, and a number of convenient ways to stay on top of events and changes within a project.

See [https://trac.edgewall.org/](https://trac.edgewall.org/) for more on Trac.
